# Whole Slide Imaging for image generation

## 1. Short description

Whole Slide Imaging is one of the primary techniques that allows the creation of large pathological datasets. A whole slide image (WSI) usually contains a tissue sample that was prepared using various pathological staining and drying procedures. 
To view such an image there exists a good number of tools such as the softwares SlideViewer and QuPath which offer tools to for example, annotate on the slides. 
However, when it comes to performing analysis on a great amount of images extracted from WSIs, it is generally a better idea to utilise programming packages like openslide-python.
